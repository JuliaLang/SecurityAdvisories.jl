No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN*mod*exp may be affected if they use BN*FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.1+2"}]}],"package":{"ecosystem":"Julia","name":"OpenSSL_jll"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.19.9+0"}]}],"package":{"ecosystem":"Julia","name":"Openresty_jll"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00030.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155754/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=419102400a2811582a7a3d4a4e317d72e5ce0a8f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=f1c5eea8a817075d31e43f5876993c6710238c98"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00023.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDHOAATPWJCXRNFMJ2SASDBBNU5RJONY/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EXDDAOWSAIEFQNBHWYE6PPYFV4QXGMCD/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XVEP3LAK4JSPRXFO4QF4GG2IVXADV3SO/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/39"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/46"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191210-0001/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4504-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4594"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4855"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20191206.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-03"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00030.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155754/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=419102400a2811582a7a3d4a4e317d72e5ce0a8f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=f1c5eea8a817075d31e43f5876993c6710238c98"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00023.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDHOAATPWJCXRNFMJ2SASDBBNU5RJONY/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EXDDAOWSAIEFQNBHWYE6PPYFV4QXGMCD/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XVEP3LAK4JSPRXFO4QF4GG2IVXADV3SO/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/39"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/46"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191210-0001/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4504-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4594"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4855"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20191206.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-03"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10"}],"database_specific":{"source":{"modified":"2024-11-21T04:36:48.500Z","html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1551","id":"CVE-2019-1551","imported":"2025-09-23T21:56:30.609Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2019-1551","published":"2019-12-06T18:15:12.840Z"}}}
