If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature*algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature*algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.10+0"}]}],"package":{"ecosystem":"Julia","name":"OpenSSL_jll"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/27/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/27/2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/28/3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/28/4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-772220.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=fb9fa6b51defd48157eeb207f52181f735d96148"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44845"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10356"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/08/msg00029.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CCBFLLVQVILIVGZMBJL3IXZGKWQISYNP/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0013"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-21:07.openssl.asc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202103-03"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210326-0006/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210513-0002/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-openssl-2021-GHY28dJd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4875"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210325.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-05"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-06"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-09"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/27/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/27/2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/28/3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/28/4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-772220.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=fb9fa6b51defd48157eeb207f52181f735d96148"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44845"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10356"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/08/msg00029.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CCBFLLVQVILIVGZMBJL3IXZGKWQISYNP/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0013"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-21:07.openssl.asc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202103-03"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210326-0006/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210513-0002/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-openssl-2021-GHY28dJd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4875"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210325.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-05"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-06"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/securit
