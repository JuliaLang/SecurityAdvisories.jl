    "summary": "Argument injection in `gettreesha()` function in Registrator.jl",
    "details": "### Impact\n\nIf the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), an argument injection is possible in the `gettreesha()` function. This can then lead to a potential RCE.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5. All prior versions are vulnerable.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/449 (which is available in v1.9.5).\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.",
