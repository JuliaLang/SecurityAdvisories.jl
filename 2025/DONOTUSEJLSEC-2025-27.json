This can then lead to a potential RCE.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5. All prior versions are vulnerable.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/449 (which is available in v1.9.5).\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.9.4"}]}],"package":{"ecosystem":"Julia","name":"Registrator"}}],"database_specific":{"sources":[{"id":"GHSA-w8jv-rg3h-fc68","imported":"2025-09-23T21:55:52.259Z","modified":"2025-06-24T23:01:40Z","published":"2025-06-24T23:01:40Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/security-advisories/GHSA-w8jv-rg3h-fc68","html_url":"https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/security/advisories/GHSA-w8jv-rg3h-fc68"}]}}
