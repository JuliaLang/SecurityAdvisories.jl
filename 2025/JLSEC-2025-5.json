    "summary": "Lack of validation for user-provided fields in GitHub.jl",
    "details": "There is a lack of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions.\n\nIn the `GitHub.repo()` function, the user can provide any string for the `repo_name` field. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v5.9.1 or later. All prior versions are vulnerable. We recommend users upgrade to v5.10.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl/pull/224 (which is available in v5.9.1).\n\n### Credits\n\n*splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reported similar issues in other packages. Audit of equivalent problems in this package resulted in this issue, found by Dilum Aluthge.",
