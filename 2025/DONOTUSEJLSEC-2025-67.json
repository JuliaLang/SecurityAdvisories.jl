    "details": "a long time.\n\nIssue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the function EVP*PKEY*public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhen function EVP*PKEY*public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation would take a long time.\n\nAn application that calls EVP*PKEY*public_check() and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function EVP*PKEY*public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.\n",
