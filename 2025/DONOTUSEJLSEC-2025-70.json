    "summary": "Command injection in `withpasswd()` function in Registrator.jl\n",
    "details": "### Impact\n\nIf the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), a shell script injection can occur within the `withpasswd()` function.  This can then lead to a potential RCE. \n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5. All prior versions are vulnerable. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/448 (which is available in v1.9.5).\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.\n",
