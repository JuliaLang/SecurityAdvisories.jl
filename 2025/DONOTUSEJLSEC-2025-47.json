To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.\n\nFor example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.20+0"}]}],"package":{"ecosystem":"Julia","name":"OpenSSL_jll"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.1+0"}]}],"package":{"ecosystem":"Julia","name":"Openresty_jll"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"}],"database_specific":{"source":{"modified":"2025-03-20T21:15:14.890Z","html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4304","id":"CVE-2022-4304","imported":"2025-09-23T21:56:31.088Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2022-4304","published":"2023-02-08T20:15:23.887Z"}}}
