This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the *parent* directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.36.1+0"}]}],"package":{"ecosystem":"Julia","name":"Git_jll"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/May/31"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5PTN5NYEHYN2OQSHSAMCNICZNK2U4QH6/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BENQYTDGUL6TF3UALY6GSIEXIHUIYNWM/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDI325LOO2XBDDKLINOAQJEG6MHAURZE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIKWISWUDFT2FAITYIA6372BVLH3OOOC/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVOLER2PIGMHPQMDGG4RDE2KZB74QLA2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SLP42KIZ6HACTVZMZLJLFJQ4W2XYT27M/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRZG5CDUQ27OWTPC5MQOR4UASNXHWEZS/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UDZRZAL7QULOB6V7MKT66MOMWJLBJPX4/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YROCMBWYFKRSS64PO6FUNM6L7LKBUKVW/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213261"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/May/31"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5PTN5NYEHYN2OQSHSAMCNICZNK2U4QH6/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BENQYTDGUL6TF3UALY6GSIEXIHUIYNWM/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDI325LOO2XBDDKLINOAQJEG6MHAURZE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIKWISWUDFT2FAITYIA6372BVLH3OOOC/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVOLER2PIGMHPQMDGG4RDE2KZB74QLA2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SLP42KIZ6HACTVZMZLJLFJQ4W2XYT27M/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRZG5CDUQ27OWTPC5MQOR4UASNXHWEZS/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UDZRZAL7QULOB6V7MKT66MOMWJLBJPX4/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YROCMBWYFKRSS64PO6FUNM6L7LKBUKVW/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213261"}],"database_specific":{"sources":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24765","imported":"2025-09-23T02:52:12.922Z","modified":"2024-11-21T06:51:02.873Z","published":"2022-04-12T18:15:09.390Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2022-24765","html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24765"}]}}
