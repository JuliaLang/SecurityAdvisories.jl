# Lack of validation for user-provided fields in GitForge.jl

### Description

There is a lack of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions.

In the `GitForge.get_repo()` function for GitHub, the user can provide any string for the `owner` and `repo fields`. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.

### Impact

This means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.

### Patches

Users should upgrade immediately to v0.4.3. All prior versions are vulnerable.

### Workarounds

None

### References

Fixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitForge.jl/pull/50 (which is available in v0.4.3).

Thanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.
