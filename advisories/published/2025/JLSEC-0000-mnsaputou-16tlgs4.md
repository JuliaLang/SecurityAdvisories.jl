# An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.2 and 3.x before 3.3.0

An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.2 and 3.x before 3.3.0. There is a potential heap-based buffer overflow and heap-based buffer over-read in DTLS if MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CONNECTION_ID is enabled and MBEDTLS_SSL_CID_IN_LEN_MAX > 2 * MBEDTLS_SSL_CID_OUT_LEN_MAX.
