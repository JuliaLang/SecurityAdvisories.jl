# A flaw was found in libssh, a library that implements the SSH protocol

A flaw was found in libssh, a library that implements the SSH protocol. When calculating the session ID during the key exchange (KEX) process, an allocation failure in cryptographic functions may lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This issue can cause the client or server to crash.
