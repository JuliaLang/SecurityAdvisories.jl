# Argument injection in `gettreesha()` function in Registrator.jl

### Impact

If the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), an argument injection is possible in the `gettreesha()` function. This can then lead to a potential RCE.

### Patches

Users should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5. All prior versions are vulnerable.

### Workarounds

None

### References

Fixed by: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/449 (which is available in v1.9.5).
