# Lack of validation for user-provided fields in GitHub.jl

There is a lack of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions.

In the `GitHub.repo()` function, the user can provide any string for the `repo_name` field. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.

### Impact

This means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.

### Patches

Users should upgrade immediately to v5.9.1 or later. All prior versions are vulnerable. We recommend users upgrade to v5.10.0

### Workarounds

None

### References

Fixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl/pull/224 (which is available in v5.9.1).
