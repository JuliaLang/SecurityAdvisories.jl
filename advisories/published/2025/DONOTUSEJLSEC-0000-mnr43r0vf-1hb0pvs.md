# Integer overflow in libaom internal function img*alloc*helper can lead to heap buffer overflow

Integer overflow in libaom internal functionÂ img*alloc*helper can lead to heap buffer overflow. This function can be reached via 3 callers:

  * Calling aom*img*alloc() with a large value of the d*w, d*h, or align parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom*image*t struct may be invalid.
  * Calling aom*img*wrap() with a large value of the d*w, d*h, or align parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom*image*t struct may be invalid.
  * Calling aom*img*alloc*with*border() with a large value of the d*w, d*h, align, size*align, or border parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom*image_t struct may be invalid.
