# HTTP.jl is an HTTP client and server functionality for the Julia programming language

HTTP.jl is an HTTP client and server functionality for the Julia programming language. Prior to version 1.10.19, HTTP.jl did not validate header names/values for illegal characters, allowing CRLF-based header injection and response splitting. This enables HTTP response splitting and header injection, leading to cache poisoning, XSS, session fixation, and more. This issue is fixed in HTTP.jl  `v1.10.19`.
