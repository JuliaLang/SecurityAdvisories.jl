summary: " Lack of validation for user-provided fields in GitForge.jl"
modified: "2025-06-24T23:01:20Z"
details: |-
  ### Description
  
  There is a lack of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions. 
  
  In the `GitForge.get_repo()` function for GitHub, the user can provide any string for the `owner` and `repo fields`. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.
  
  ### Impact
  
  This means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.
  
  ### Patches
  
  Users should upgrade immediately to v0.4.3. All prior versions are vulnerable.
  
  ### Workarounds
  
  None
  
  ### References
  
  Fixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitForge.jl/pull/50 (which is available in v0.4.3).
  
  ### Credits
  
  Thanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.
