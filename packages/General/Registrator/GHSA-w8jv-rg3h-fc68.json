  "summary": "Argument injection in `gettreesha()` function in Registrator.jl",
  "details": "### Impact\r\n\r\nIf the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), an argument injection is possible in the `gettreesha()` function. This can then lead to a potential RCE.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5. All prior versions are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/449 (which is available in v1.9.5).\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.",
