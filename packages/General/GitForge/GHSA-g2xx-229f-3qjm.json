  "summary": " Lack of validation for user-provided fields in GitForge.jl",
  "details": "### Description\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions. \r\n\r\nIn the `GitForge.get_repo()` function for GitHub, the user can provide any string for the `owner` and `repo fields`. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v0.4.3. All prior versions are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitForge.jl/pull/50 (which is available in v0.4.3).\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.",
