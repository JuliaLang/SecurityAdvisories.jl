summary: "Argument injection in `gettreesha()` function in Registrator.jl"
modified: "2025-06-24T23:01:40Z"
details: |-
  ### Impact
  
  If the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), an argument injection is possible in the `gettreesha()` function. This can then lead to a potential RCE.
  
  ### Patches
  
  Users should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5. All prior versions are vulnerable.
  
  ### Workarounds
  
  None
  
  ### References
  
  Fixed by: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/449 (which is available in v1.9.5).
  
  ### Credits
  
  Thanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.
