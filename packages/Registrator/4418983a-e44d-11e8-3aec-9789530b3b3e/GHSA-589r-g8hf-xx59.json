{"summary":"Command injection in `withpasswd()` function in Registrator.jl","modified":"2025-06-24T23:01:34Z","details":"### Impact\r\n\r\nIf the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), a shell script injection can occur within the `withpasswd()` function.  This can then lead to a potential RCE. \r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5. All prior versions are vulnerable. \r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/448 (which is available in v1.9.5).\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.","aliases":["CVE-2025-52483"],"affected":[{"ranges":[{"events":[{"fixed":"<=1.9.4","introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"package":{"name":"Registrator.jl","ecosystem":"julia"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/security/advisories/GHSA-589r-g8hf-xx59"}],"id":"GHSA-589r-g8hf-xx59","severity":[{"score":"critical","type":"CVSS_V3"}],"schema_version":"1.6.7","published":"2025-06-24T23:01:34Z"}
