{"summary":"Lack of validation for user-provided fields in GitHub.jl","modified":"2025-06-24T23:01:49Z","details":"There is a lack of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions.\r\n\r\nIn the `GitHub.repo()` function, the user can provide any string for the `repo_name` field. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v5.9.1 or later. All prior versions are vulnerable. We recommend users upgrade to v5.10.0\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl/pull/224 (which is available in v5.9.1).\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\n *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reported similar issues in other packages.
