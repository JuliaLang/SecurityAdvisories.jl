summary: "Lack of validation for user-provided fields in GitHub.jl"
modified: "2025-06-24T23:01:49Z"
details: |-
  There is a lack of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions.
  
  In the `GitHub.repo()` function, the user can provide any string for the `repo_name` field. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.
  
  ### Impact
  
  This means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.
  
  ### Patches
  
  Users should upgrade immediately to v5.9.1 or later. All prior versions are vulnerable. We recommend users upgrade to v5.10.0
  
  ### Workarounds
  
  None
  
  ### References
  
  Fixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl/pull/224 (which is available in v5.9.1).
